# Restaurant Tinder Decisions
* We used MongoDB for data storage/persistence and have a free tier cluster on MongoDB Atlas
* In our version, hosts are automatically joined into the group once 'Get Restaurants' is clicked
* In our verison, the home page has 2 buttons to either create or join a room
* If the user selects to join a room, they can copy/paste a link provided to them by the host to be added to the room
